# Data-Science-in-Telco-Data-Cleansing
DQLab Telco is a Telco company that already has many branches spread everywhere. Since its establishment in 2019, DQLab Telco has been consistent in paying attention to its customer experience so that it will not be abandoned by customers.
Even though it is only a little over 1 year old, DQLab Telco already has many customers who have switched subscriptions to competitors. The management wants to reduce the number of churn customers by using machine learning.
Therefore, the Data Scientist team was asked to prepare data as well as create the right prediction model to determine whether customers will churn or not.

As a data scientist, you are required to prepare data before modeling.

In this task, you will perform Data Preprocessing (Data Cleansing) last month, namely June 2020.
The steps to be taken are :

  1. Looking for a valid customer ID (Phone number)
  2. Overcome data that is still empty (Missing Values)
  3. Overcoming Outlier Values from each Variable
  4. Standardizing the Value of a Variable
